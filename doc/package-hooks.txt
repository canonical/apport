Apport per-package hooks
========================

Packages can add additional fields (or even modify existing fields, if
they want) of Apport crash or bug reports by placing a Python code
snippet into

  /usr/share/apport/package-hooks/<packagename>.py

or

  /usr/share/apport/package-hooks/source_<sourcepackagename>.py

Apport will import this and call a function

  add_info(report, ui)

and pass two arguments:

 - The currently processed problem report. This is an instance of
   apport.Report, and should mainly be used as a dictionary. Please see the
   Python help of this class for details:

   >>> import apport
   >>> help(apport.Report)

 - The Apport user interface. This is an instance of apport.ui.UserInterface
   and can be used to interactively get more information from the user, such as
   asking for doing a particular action, yes/no question, multiple choices, or
   a file selector. Please see the Python help for available functions (in
   particular, the ui_*() ones):

   >>> import apport.ui
   >>> help(apport.ui.UserInterface)

If you do not need to ask interactive questions, you can ignore ui, or just
declare "add_info(report)".

Package independent hooks
=========================

Similarly to per-package hooks, you can also have additional
information collected for any crash or bug. For example, you might
want to include violation logs from SELinux or AppArmor for every
crash. The interface and file format is identical to the per-package
hooks, except that they need to be put into

  /usr/share/apport/general-hooks/<hookname>.py

The <hookname> can be arbitrary and should describe the functionality.

Customize the crash DB to use
=============================

To use another crash database than the default one, you should create
an hook that adds a 'CrashDB' field with the name of the database to
use. See /etc/apport/crashdb.conf and
/etc/apport/crashdb.conf.d/*.conf for available databases.

Examples
========

Trivial example: To attach a log file /var/log/foo.log for crashes in
binary package foo, put this into /usr/share/apport/package-hooks/foo.py:

------------ 8< ----------------
import os.path

def add_info(report):
    if os.path.exists('/var/log/foo.log'):
        report['FooLog'] = open('/var/log/foo.log').read()
------------ 8< ----------------

Apport itself ships a source package hook, see
/usr/share/apport/package-hooks/source_apport.py.

An interesting use case of hooks is to detect situations which should
not be reported as bugs, because they happen on known-bad hardware,
from a third-party repository, or other situations. This can be
achieved by adding a field

  report['UnreportableReason'] = _('explanation')

Such reports are displayed by the apport frontends as
unsupportable/unreportable with the given explanation. Please ensure
proper i18n for the texts.

If you want to entirely ignore a crash without presenting an
explanatory error dialog box, use "Ignore" instead of
"UnreportableReason":

  report['Ignore'] = 'True'

(the actual value does not matter, it just must be a string).

If you write hooks, please have a look at the apport.hookutils
module first: 

 python -c 'import apport.hookutils; help(apport.hookutils)'

It provides readymade and safe functions many standard situations, 
such as getting a command's output, attaching a file's contents, 
attaching hardware related information, etc.
