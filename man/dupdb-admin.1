.SH DESCRIPTION

.BR apport\-retrace (1)
has the capability of checking for duplicate bugs (amonst other
things). It uses an SQLite database for keeping track of master bugs.
.B dupdb\-admin
is a small tool to manage that database.

The central concept in that database is a "crash signature", a string
that uniquely identifies a particular crash. It is built from the
executable path name, the signal number or exception name, and the
topmost functions of the stack trace.

The database maps crash signatures to the 'master' crash id and thus
can close duplicate crash reports with a reference to that master ID.
It also tracks the status of crashes (open/fixed in a particular
version) to be able to identify regressions.

.SH MODES

.TP
.B dump
Print a list of all database entries.

.TP
.B changeid
Change the associated crash ID for a particular crash.

.TP
.B publish
Export the duplicate database into a set of text files in the given directory
which is suitable for WWW publishing.
If the directory already exists, it will be updated. The new content is built
in a new directory which is the given one with ".new" appended, then moved to
the given name in an almost atomic way.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-f \fIpath\fR, \fB\-\-database-file\fR=\fIpath
