This file summarizes the major and interesting changes for each release. For a
detailled list of changes, please see ChangeLog.

1.9.1 (2009-09-22)
------------------
Bug fixes:
 - hookutils.py, attach_hardware(): Do not attach empty Pccardctl*.
 - apport/report.py, add_gdb_info(): Do not throw away stderr from gdb.
 - data/general-hooks/parse_segv.py:
   + Handle arithmetic wrapping correctly.
   + Handle empty base, scale, or index registers in disassembly.
   + Handle in/out ioport faults.
 - Various improvements to user-visible strings, thanks to Marco Rodrigues!
   (LP: #178507)
 - Various apport-retrace robustifications.
 - setup.py: Fix DistUtilsExtra version check. (LP: #428337)
 - hookutils.py, attach_gconf(): Do not overwrite previous values from other
   packages, thanks Loïc Minier!
 - hookutils.py, attach_gconf(): Fix crash with nonexisting <applyto> tags.

1.9 (2009-09-08)
----------------
New features:
 - Add "do what I mean" mode to command line argument parsing (applies to all
   interfaces: -cli, -gtk, -kde). When giving a single argument and no options,
   determine the most likely mode, like reporting a bug against a symptom,
   package, executable name, or PID.
 - Add program "apport-bug" which determines the most appropriate user
   interface (GTK, KDE, CLI) and files a bug through it, using the single
   argument "do what I mean" mode. This is an improved version of Ubuntu's
   "ubuntu-bug" script.

Bug fixes:
 - Update apport-cli manpage to current set of options and behaviour. Also
   point out that apport-gtk and apport-kde share the same CLI.
 - setup.py now installs apport-{gtk,kde} into $prefix/share/apport/, they are
   not supposed to be called directly. This also reflects the path which the
   .desktop files expect.
 - setup.py now installs the internal helper scripts like "kernel_crashdump",
   "apport", or "apportcheckresume" into $prefix/share/apport instead of
   $prefix/bin.
 - Update usage of gettext to work around Python bug of gettext() not returning
   unicodes, but str. Fixes UnicodeDecodeErrors on translated --help output.

1.8.2 (2009-09-05)
------------------
Bug fixes.

1.8.1 (2009-09-03)
------------------
Lots of bug fixes.

1.8 (2009-08-26)
----------------
New features:
 - Do not generally ignore SIGABRT any more. Try to extract the assertion
   message from the core dump, and add it as "AssertionMessage" field. Mark
   reports as unreportable if they do not have an assertion message and crashed
   with SIGABRT. This requires your glibc to have this patch:
   http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=48dcd0ba
 - report.py, add_hooks_info(): Add optional package/srcpackage argument. Hooks
   can use that to change the affected package or call hooks from different
   packages.
 - KDE frontend implementation of ui_question_userpass(), for crash databases
   which need to ask for credentials.
 - hookutils.py: New funtion attach_wifi() to add wireless network related
   information to reports.

Important bug fixes:
 - Fix the test suite on current kernels; test/crash previously often failed
   with python segfaults, since it killed the test processes too early.

1.7 (2009-08-05):
-----------------
New features:
 - Support for "symptom" scripts, which figure out the package for a bug report
   based on interactive questions.

1.6 (2009-07-15)
----------------
New features:
 - Integrate analysis and retracing of kernel vmcore crashes with the "crash"
   tool. Courtesy of Michael Vogt.

Various little bug fixes.

1.5 (2009-06-29)
----------------
New features:
 - Drop all Makefiles, po/POTFILES.in, and most code from setup.py, and use
   DistUtilsExtras.auto which "just does the right thing" for most build system
   tasks. This requires python-distutils-extra >= 2.2, see
   https://launchpad.net/python-distutils-extra

Cleanup:
 - Move all test scripts into test/, to unclutter source tree.
 - setup.py now auto-detects the required packaging backend if
   apport/packaging_impl.py is not manually installed.

1.4 (2009-06-26)
----------------
New features:
 - Replaced Qt4 frontend with a KDE frontend for better KDE integration.

Major bug fixes:
 - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Add backwards compatibility code for python-apt <
   0.7.9 to not break backportability.

1.3 (2009-06-10)
----------------
New features:
- Interactive package hooks:
  * Add apport.ui.HookUI class which provides GUI functionality such as yes/no
    questions or file dialogs to hooks.
  * add_info() in package hooks now can (optionally) take a second argument which
    is the HookUI instance.
  * See doc/package-hooks.txt for details.
- New function apport.hookutils.root_command_output() to run a command as root,
  through gksu/kdesudo/sudo, depending on the desktop environment.
- Add general hook for analyzing reason of a segfault.

Bug fixes:
- Drop "UnsupportableReason" field, it is too similar to UnreportableReason and
  just confusing.
- Report key names can now contain dashes ('-') and underscores ('_').
  (LP #380811)

1.2.1 (2009-05-15)
------------------
Bug fixes:
- Fix setup.py and PO file merging for recent .glade -> .ui renaming.

Translations:
- Update German translations.

1.2.0 (2009-05-15)
------------------
Moving away from deprecated APIs:
- packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Use python-apt >= 0.7.9 official API and drop usage of
  internal symbols.
- hookutils.py: Drop hal related functions and queries, replace with udev
  database, udev log file, and DMI information from sysfs.
- gtk UI: Convert from libglade to gtk.Builder.

Bug fixes:
- hookutils.py: Drop /proc/version_signature collection, it is Ubuntu specific.
- apportcheckresume: Fix log collection from pm-utils.
- Fix various crashes and report properties for reporting against uninstalled
  packages.

1.1.1 (2009-04-30)
------------------
Security fix:
- etc/cron.daily/apport: Only attempt to remove files and symlinks, do not
  descend into subdirectories of /var/crash/. Doing so might be exploited by a
  race condition between find traversing a huge directory tree, changing an
  existing subdir into a symlink to e. g. /etc/, and finally getting that piped
  to rm. This also changes the find command to not use GNU extensions.  Thanks
  to Stephane Chazelas for discovering this! (LP #357024, CVE-2009-1295)

Bug fixes:
- launchpad.py: Send and read Date: field again, reverting r1128; it is useful
  after all. (LP #349139)
- Only add ProcAttrCurrent to reports if it is not "unconfined", to remove some
  noise from reports.
- Detect invalid PIDs in the UI (such as for kernel processes) and give a
  friendly error message instead of silently doing nothing. (LP #360608)
- Always run common hooks, and run source package hooks if we do not have a
  binary package name. (LP #350131)
- launchpad.py: Consider socket errors when connecting as transient, so
  that crash-digger doesn't stop completely on them.

1.1 (2009-04-20)
----------------
New features:
- Add hookutils methods for attaching relevant packages, greatly improve
  attach_alsa() for sound problem debugging. 
- Move launchpad crash database implementation from ever-breaking
  python-launchpad-bugs (screenscraping) to launchpadlib (official and stable
  Launchpad API).

Bug fixes:
- Drop some remaining distro specific pieces of code.
- Add new field Report.pid which gets set on add_proc_info() and can be used by
  hooks.
- setup.py: Properly clean up all generated files, install missing
  mimetypes/text-x-apport.svg icon symlink.
- Add README file.
- Add translations from Launchpad.
- Remove preloadlib/*; it's undermaintained, and not really useful any more
  these days.
- Various bug fixes; most visible being the misnamed etc/default/apport.default
  file (which should just be etc/default/apport).

1.0 (2009-04-06)
----------------
First upstream release, based on Ubuntu packaging branch; that had been the
de-facto trunk for many years, but this becomes unpractical with several
distributions using it now.
