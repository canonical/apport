This file summarizes the major and interesting changes for each release. For a
detailled list of changes, please see ChangeLog.

1.94 (UNRELEASED)
-----------------
Bug fixes:
 - apport: Set the group of written reports to "whoopsie" if that group exists.
 - Fix tests to run properly against the system-installed modules and binaries.
 - test/run: Run under LC_MESSAGES=C to avoid test failures due to translated
   strings.
 - general-hooks/generic.py: Also attach xsession-errors for programs that link
   to libgtk-3.
 - launchpad.py: Properly handle "Expired" status, to avoid marking new bugs as
   duplicates of expired ones. (LP: #941854)
 - apport: Fix crash if the "whoopsie" group does not exist. (LP: #942326)
 - report.py, crash_signature(): Do not put "<module>" frames into Python crash
   signatures that happen outside of function/method calls. Fall back to the
   file/line number as a frame description instead. This will do a much better
   job at disambiguating e. g. different ImportError crashes. (LP: #920403)
 - Make "binary changed since the time of the crash" error message more
   comprehensible, thanks Paolo Rotolo. (LP: #942830)
 - crashdb.py, check_duplicate(): It can happen that a bug gets identified as
   being a duplicate of bug S by symbolic signatures and a duplicate of bug A
   by address signatures. Empirical evidence shows that this is due to the
   unavoidable jitter in stack traces (A and S not being identified as
   duplicates as their signatures differ slightly) and not a logic error. So
   instead of erroring out, duplicate all three bugs and keep the lowest number
   as the master ID. (LP: #943117)
 - Revert the usage of multiple nested threads during data collection, and
   switch back to only using one UI thread. The UI implementations can, and now
   do, decide between showing a spinner and showing a progress dialog in the
   ui_*_info_collection_progress() methods. This fixes libX11 crashes when
   multiple UI threads do changes concurrently (LP: #901675), and also avoids
   multi-thread induced crashes in Pango (LP: #943661). The removal of the
   collect() method, this also fixes the new crashes in it. (LP: #942098, 
   LP: #939803)
 - ui.py, get_desktop_entry(): Fix crash on uninstalled package. (LP: #940984)
 - data/unkillable_shutdown: Fix crash on race condition when PID goes away
   while the report is created. (LP: #546369)
 - apport/hookutils.py, pci_devices(): Fix crash on unexpected lines from
   lspci. (LP: #904489)

Improvements:
 - test/run: Drop "local" argument. This now tests against the source tree when
   run in the source tree root, and against the system libraries/programs when
   run from anywhere else.
 - test/run: Consider command line arguments as test names and only run those
   when given. Also support just running a single test.
 - testsuite: Force the skipping of online tests when $SKIP_ONLINE_TESTS is
   set.
 - hookutils.py, xsession_errors(): Add a reasonable default pattern which
   matches glib-style warnings, errors, criticals etc. and X window errors.
   In data/general-hooks/generic.py, call it with that default instead of the
   rather incomplete custom pattern. (LP: #932660)
 - packaging.py: Add get_package_origin() method, and implement it for
   apt-dpkg.
 - report.py, add_package_info(): Add "[origin: ...]" tag to "Package" and
   "Dependencies" fields for any package which is not native to the
   distribution. If any such package is present, tag the report with
   "third-party-packages" in data/general-hooks/generic.py. (LP: #927912)
 - apport/packaging.py: Add get_uninstalled_package() method as a helper method
   for the test suite. Use it instead of a hardcoded Debian/Ubuntu specific
   name in test/test_hooks.py.
 - test/test_ui_{gtk,kde}.py: Add test cases for complete UI workflow runs for
   reporting a bug against an installed/uninstalled package, and reporting a
   crash with and without showing details. This reproduces the recent crashes
   like LP #901675 or LP #943661.
 - test_ui.py: Add a test case for reporting a complete report on uninstalled
   package. This happens when reporting a problem from a different machine
   through copying a .crash file.

1.93 (2012-02-23):
------------------
Bug fixes:
 - apport-gtk: Fix crash on nonexisting icon. Thanks Evan Dandrea.
   (LP: #937354)
 - ui.py, open_url(): Revert back to calling sudo instead of dropping
   privileges ourselves; with the latter, calling firefox as the sudo'ing user
   fails. (LP: #916810, #938128)
 - ui.py: Fix aborting with "AssertionError" if the report is already known,
   but without an URL. (LP: #938778)
 - launchpad.py: If a bug is already known, but the report is private, do not
   send the report. There is little sense piling up lots of duplicates.
   (LP: #938700)
 - test/crash: Fix regression of test_crash_apport(), consider $TERM a
   non-sensitive variable.
 - ui.py: Fix test failures for data collection progress, they are not expected
   to happen for "ProblemType: Crash" any more (happens in the background
   during sending, or if user clicks on "Show Details").
 - test/hooks: Use a package from Debian/Ubuntu main, so that this works better
   during package builds on build servers.
 - test/python: Do not assume that /var/crash/ exists. Use /var/tmp/ for the
   fake binaries instead.
 - data/general-hooks/parse_segv.py: Fix test case name.
 - ui.py: Fix crash on invalid core dumps. (LP: #937215)
 - launchpad.py: Fix crash on unicode report titles. (LP: #896626)

Improvements:
 - apport-gtk: Show the most interesting fields first in the details view.
 - do-release: Call pyflakes and abort on errors other than unused imports.
 - Move all test suites out of the code modules into test/test_<module>.py.
   This avoids having to load it every time the program runs, and also allows
   running the tests against the installed version of Apport.
 - Clean up the other executable test script in test/* and change them to the
   same structure as the module tests.

1.92 (2012-02-20):
------------------
Bug fixes:
 - ui.py: Fix wrong creation of "~" folder instead of expanding it to home
   directory when using "Examine locally". Thanks Jason Conti! (LP: #909149)
 - Replace file() calls with open() for Python 3 compatibility. Thanks Colin
   Watson!
 - launchpad.py: Avoid sending tag names with upper case. (LP: #924181)
 - report.py, crash_signature_addresses(): Fix crash if report does not have
   "Signal".
 - apport-gtk: Fix resize handling of expander in details window. Thanks Thomas
   Bechtold! (LP: #930562)
 - Clean up unnecessary imports. Thanks Evan Dandrea!

Improvements:
 - man/apport-bug.1: Mention where crash files are stored. Thanks David
   Kastrup.
 - hookutils.py, attach_hardware(): Sort ProcModules, thanks Brian Murray.
 - launchpad.py: Keep "Dependencies" attachment in duplicates. Thanks Brian
   Murray.
 - Reorganize the GNOME and KDE user interface to do the crash notifications
   and detail browser in a single dialog. Add test/gtk and test/kde tests to
   check expected dialog layout for different cases. Thanks Evan Dandrea!
 - Add support for the whoopsie-daisy crash reporting daemon by creating
   zero-byte .upload file stamps for crash reports. Thanks Evan Dandrea!

1.91 (2012-01-18):
------------------
Bug fixes:
 - crashdb.py, check_duplicate(): If a crash has a signature but no existing
   duplicate in the DB, also check for an existing address signature duplicate
   in the DB.
 - apport-retrace: Use DistroRelease specific subdirectory of the cache dir for
   mapping a file to a package, as these maps are release specific.
 - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Refresh Contents.gz cache if it is older than one
   day.
 - crashdb.py: Ensure that address_signature duplicate db table does not have
   multiple identical signatures by making it a primary key. Bump the db format
   to "3". Existing databases need to be migrated manually as SQLite does not
   allow adding a "PRIMARY KEY" constraint to existing tables.
 - crashdb.py: Do not add a new address signature entry if one already exists.
 - apport-cli: Fix UnicodeDecodeError on unicode report values. (LP: #275972)
 - launchpad.py: Only set bug task importance if it is undecided.
 - apport-retrace: Fix "an useful" typo. (LP: #911437)
 - report.py: Filter out frames which are internal kernel/glibc implementation
   details and not stable across duplicates. In particular, filter out
   __kernel-syscall() and the SSE stubs.
 - crashdb.py: Remove debugging leftover which completely disabled bug pattern
   checking.
 - report.py: Update reading AssertionMessage. Current (e)glibc turned
   __abort_msg from a simple static string into a struct.

Improvements:
 - Change permissions of .crash files from 0600 to 0640, so that /var/crash can
   be made g+s and crash handling daemons can access those.
 - Python exceptions: Blacklist DBus.Error.NoReply. It does not help to get
   these traces from the client-side application, you need the actual exception
   in the D-Bus server backend instead. (LP: #914220)
 - Support /etc/apport/whitelist.d/ similarly to /etc/apport/blacklist.d/, for
   cases like installer environments where only crashes of a few selected
   programs should be reported.

1.90 (2011-11-24):
------------------
First beta release of 2.0 which introduces client-side duplicate checking.

Bug fixes:
 - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix another test case failure when ddeb
   repository is not enabled.
 - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix handling of explicit cache directory
   name when it is a relative path.
 - launchpad.py: Only query for bugs after 2011-08-01, to avoid timeouts.
 - ui.py: Also anonymize standard bug title. (LP: #893863)
 - launchpad.py: Current Launchpad cannot have private bugs which affect
   multiple projects. Fix test suite accordingly.

Improvements:
 - report.py: Break out new method stacktrace_top_function() from
   standard_title(), so that other parts of the code can use this as well.
 - launchpad.net: When sending retraced results back to the bug report, update
   the topmost function in the bug title. (LP: #869970)
 - report.py, add_gdb_info(): Add a new field "StacktraceAddressSignature"
   which is a heuristic signature for signal crashes. This should be used if
   crash_signature() fails, i. e. the Stacktrace field does not have enough
   symbols. This can be used to check for duplicates on the client side,
   provided that the crash database server supports querying for these.
   Do not expose this field when uploading to crash databases though, as it can
   be recomputed from the already existing information (ProcMaps and
   Stacktrace) and thus would just clutter the reports.
 - crashdb.py: Add a table "version" with the database format version. Add
   automatic upgrading to the most current format.
 - crashdb.py: Put address signatures from reports checked with
   check_duplicate() into the duplicate database, so that implementations of
   known() can check for these.
 - dupdb-admin: Add "publish" dupdb-admin command which exports the
   duplicate database into a set of text files suitable for WWW publishing.
 - crashdb.py: Add new method "known(report)" which can be implemented to check
   if the crash db already knows about the crash signature. If so, the report
   will not be uploaded, and instead the user will be directed to the existing
   report URL (if available), similar to bug patterns. The default
   implementation checks this format, if the crash database is initialized with
   a "dupdb_url" option pointing to the exported database.
 - launchpad.py: Override known() to check if the master bug is actually
   accessible by the reporter, and is not tagged with "apport-failed-retrace"
   or "apport-request-retrace"; otherwise file it anyway.
 - crash-digger: Add --publish-db option to conveniently integrate duplicate DB
   publication (similar to dupdb-admin publish) into retracer setups.
 - launchpad.py: Attach updated stack traces from a duplicate to the master bug
   if it failed retracing previously or has an "apport-request-retrace" tag.
   (LP: #869982)
 - apport-kde, apport-gtk: Support the "Annotation" field for custom dialog
   titles for "Crash" and "Package" problem types as well, not just for
   "Kernel". (LP: #664378)

1.26 (2011-11-11):
------------------
Bug fixes:
 - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Port to current python-apt API.
 - hookutils.py: Fix path_to_key() to also work with unicode arguments.
 - test/crash: Exit successfully if apport is not enabled in the system. This
   allows packages to run the test suite during build.
 - report.py, add_proc_info(): Correctly handle "python -m <modulename>"
   programs as being interpreted and determine the appropriate module path.
 - Fix some import statements to also work for the system-installed test suite.
 - test/run: Fix testing data/general-hooks/parse_segv.py when called in
   system-installed mode.
 - apport/ui.py: Clean up test .crash file after test cases.
 - Fix tests when running as root.
 - setup.py: Fix crash when "javac -version" fails.
 - README: Update command for one-time enablement.
 - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix interleaving usage of install_packages()
   with other operations such as get_version(), by resetting the apt status
   after building and using the sandbox.
 - report.py test suite: Remove requirement that $USER is set, which makes it
   easier to run this from package build environments.
 - apport/ui.py, test/crash: Use "yes" as test process instead of "cat". The
   former is less likely to run already, and does not depend on having a stdin,
   so it runs better in test environments like autopkgtest.
 - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix tests if system does not have a dbgsym
   apt source.

Improvements:
 - Ignore a crash if gnome-session is running and says that the session is
   being shut down. These often die because X.org or other services are going
   away, are usually harmless, and just cause a lot of clutter in bug trackers.
   (LP: #460932)
 - test/crash: Rewrite using Python's unittest, to be in line with other tests,
   and be easier to maintain and extend.

1.25 (2011-11-02):
------------------
Improvements:
 - Add new response "Examine locally" to presenting the report details, which
   runs apport-retrace in the chosen mode in a terminal. This should be made
   available for crash reports if apport-retrace and a Terminal application are
   installed; add an abstrace UI method for this. (LP: #75901)
 - apport-gtk: Add "Examine locally..." button, and implement
   ui_run_terminal().
 - apport-cli: Add "Examine locally..." responses, and implement
   ui_run_terminal().
 - apport-cli: Greatly speed up displaying large reports. This also changes the
   format to avoid indenting each line with a space, and visually set apart the
   keys in a better way.
 - apport_python_hook.py: Move tests out of this file into test/python, to
   avoid having to parse the unit tests at each Python startup.
 - test/python: Also make tests work if Python hook is not installed in
   system's sitecustomize.py.
 - packaging.py: Add get_modified_conffiles() API, and implement it in
   packaging-apt-dpkg.py.
 - hookutils.py: Add attach_conffiles().
 - hookutils.py: Add attach_upstart_overrides().

Bug fixes: 
 - launchpad.py: Remove "Ubuntu" in bug response, replace with "this software".
   (LP: #883234)
 - apport-kde: Rearrange order of imports to get intended error message if
   PyKDE is not installed.
 - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Ignore hardening-wrapper diversions, to make
   gcc_ice_hook work if hardening-wrapper is installed.
 - apport_python_hook: Respect $APPORT_REPORT_DIR.
 - apport_python_hook: Limit successive crashes per program and user to 3 per
   day, just like signal crashes. (LP: #603503)
 - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Skip online tests when there is no default route.
 - ui.py: Fix test suite to not fail if system has some obsolete or non-distro
   packages.

1.24 (2011-10-19):
------------------
Bug fixes:
 - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py, install_packages(): Also copy
   apt/sources.list.d/ into sandbox.
 - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py, install_packages(): Install apt keyrings
   from config dir or from system into sandbox. (LP: #856216)
 - packaging.py, backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Define that install_packages()
   should return a SystemError for broken configs/unreachable servers etc., and
   fix the apt/dpkg implementation accordingly.
 - apport-retrace: Don't crash, just give a proper error message if servers are
   unreachable, or configuration files are broken. (LP: #859248)
 - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix crash when /etc/apport/native-origins.d
   contains any files. (LP: #865199)
 - hookutils, recent_logfile(): Fix invalid return value if log file is not
   readable. (LP: #819357)
 - test/crash: Fix race condition in the "second instance terminates
   immediately" check.
 - hookutils.py: Replace attach_gconf() with a no-op stub. It used static
   python modules like "gconf" which broke the PyGI GTK user interface, and
   gconf is rather obsolete these days.
 - ui.py, open_url(): Greatly simply and robustify by just using xdg-open. This
   already does the right thing wrt. reading the default browser from GNOME,
   KDE, XCE, and other desktops. (LP: #198449)
 - data/general-hooks/generic.py: Only attach ~/.xsession_errors if the bug is
   reported in the same XDG session as the crash happened. (LP: #869974)
 - Ignore crashes for programs which got updated in between the crash and
   reporting. (LP: #132904)
 - Special-case crashes of 'twistd': Try to determine the client program and
   assign the report to that, or fail with an UnreportableReason. (LP: #755025)
 - apport-gtk: In bug update mode, make details dialog resizable and fix
   default size. (LP: #865754)
 - apport-gtk: Fix crash if report does not have ProcCmdline. (LP: #854452)
 - hookutils.py, attach_wifi(): Anonymize ESSID and AP MAC from "iwconfig"
   output. (LP: #746900)
 - test/crash: Fix test failure if user is not in any system groups.
 - test/crash: Change to /tmp/ for test crash process, to fix failure if the
   user that runs the test suite cannot write into the current directory.
   (LP: #868695)
 - ui.py: Improve error message if package is not a genuine distro package.
   Thanks to Ronan Jouchet. (LP: #559345)

Improvements:
 - apport-retrace: Add --timestamp option to prepend a timestamp to log
   messages. This is useful for batch operations.
 - crash-digger: Call apport-retrace with --timestamps, to get consistent
   timestamps in log output.
 - hookutils.py: Add two new functions attach_gsettings_package() and
   attach_gsettings_schema() for adding user-modified gsettings keys to a
   report. (LP: #836489)
 - hookutils.py: Add new function in_session_of_problem() which returns whether
   the given report happened in the currently running XDG session. This can be
   used to determine if e. g. ~/.xsession-errors is relevant and should be
   attached.

1.23.1 (2011-09-29)
-------------------
Bug fixes:
 - apport/crashdb.py: Ensure that duplicate table only has one entry per report
   ID.
 - apport-retrace: Pass correct executable path to gdb in --gdb with --sandbox
   mode.
 - apport-retrace: Do not leave behind temporary directories on errors.
 - apport-retrace: Drop assertion failure for existance of "Stacktrace". This
   isn't present in the case of gdb crashing, and there is not much we can do
   about it. This should not break the retracer.
 - apport/report.py: Unwind XError() from stack traces for the "StacktraceTop"
   field, as they take a significant part of the trace. This causes bugs to be
   duplicated which really have different causes.

1.23 (2011-09-14)
-----------------
Improvements:
 - crashdb.py, crash-digger, dupdb-admin: Drop the concept of "duplicate DB
   consolidation". Such massive queries cause timeouts with e. g. Launchpad.
   Instead, update the status of potential master bugs in the crash DB whenever
   check_duplicate() is called.

Bug fixes:
 - launchpad.py: Fix crash in close_duplicate() if master bug was already
   marked as a duplicate of the examined bug.
 - problem_report.py, load(): Fix missing last character if the last line in a
   multi-line field is not terminated with a newline.
 - launchpad.py: Fix test_marking_python_task_mangle() check to work with
   current Launchpad.
 - apport-retrace: If the user did not specify a --cache directory, create a
   shared one instead of letting the two install_packages() calls create their
   own. This ensures that the apt and dpkg status is up to date, and avoids
   downloading the package indexes multiple times. (LP: #847951)
 - apport-retrace: Give proper error mesage instead of AssertionError crash if
   a report does not contain standard Apport format data. (LP: #843221)
 - fileutils.py, get_new_reports(): Fix crash if report file disappears in the
   middle of the operation. (LP: #640216)
 - apport/ui.py, load_report(): Intercept another case of broken report files.
   (LP: #445142)
 - apport/report.py, standard_title(): Escape regular expression control
   characters in custom exception names. (LP: #762998)

1.22.1 (2011-09-06)
-------------------
Improvements:
 - dupdb-admin: Add "removeid" command.

Bug fixes:
 - dupdb-admin: Use the in-memory CrashDB implementation for simple operations
   like dump or changeid, which do not require an actual backend. This makes
   the command work in checkouts without a /etc/apport/crashdb.conf.
 - dupdb-admin: Fix UnicodeEncodeError crash.
 - launchpad.py: Fix crash if a crash report does not have a DistroRelease.
 - Set the default "Apport" title for choice dialogs instead of the default
   apport-gtk title. Thanks Robert Roth. (LP: #608222)
 - apport-gtk: Update markup_escape_text() call to current glib. (LP: #829635)

1.22 (2011-08-25)
-----------------
Improvements:
 - Completely rework apport-retrace to use gdb's "debug-file-directory" and
   "solib-absolute-prefix" settings and only unpack the necessary packages in a
   temporary directory. This makes it possible to use it in a running system
   without actually touching installed packages, does not need any root
   privileges, and stops the requirement of using chroots with fakechroot and
   fakeroot. This is a lot easier to maintain and use, and a lot faster, too.
   As a consequence, drop the chroot module, and update crash-digger
   accordingly. See "man apport-retrace" for the new usage.
   It is now also easier to port to other packaging backends, as a lot of the
   common logic moved out of the packaging API;
   packaging.install_retracing_packages() got dropped in favor of the simpler
   packaging.install_packages().
 - crash-digger: Show how many bugs are left in the pool with each new retrace.

Bug fixes:
 - apport-gtk: Fix crash in GLib.markup_escape_text() call, regression from
   1.21.3. (LP: #828010)
 - launchpad.py: When searchTasks() times out, exit with 99 as this is a
   transient error.
 - crash-digger: Intercept OverflowError from downloaded compressed
   attachments.

1.21.3 (2011-08-17)
-------------------
Bug fixes:
 - gtk/apport-gtk.desktop.in: Also show in Unity. (LP: #803519)
 - apport-unpack: Fix crash on file errors.
 - Add apport.packaging.get_library_paths() interface and implement it for
   backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py using dpkg multiarch directories. Use it in
   chroot.py.
 - hookutils.py: Don't attach empty values. Thanks Bryce Harrington.
   (LP: #813798)
 - apport-gtk: Correctly pass message dialog type.
 - apport-gtk: Fix GLib and GObject imports to be compatible with the future
   pygobject 3.0.

Improvements:
 - hookutils.py: Add attach_mac_events() for reporting logs of MAC systems.
   Looks for AppArmor messages for now. Thanks Marc Deslauriers!
 - hookutils.py, attach_alsa(): Get a list of outputs/inputs that PulseAudio
   knows about, which also shows the currently selected output/input, as well
   as volumes. This should help with "no sound" bug troubleshooting. Thanks
   Luke Yelavich.

1.21.2 (2011-07-01)
-------------------
Improvements:
 - test/run: Check $PYTHON for using a different Python interpreter (such as
   "python3") for the tests.
 - generic hook: Don't report package installation failures due to segfaulting
   maintainer scripts. We want the actual crash report only. Thanks Brian
   Murray.
 - hookutils.py, attach_wifi(): Also include wpasupplicant logs. Thanks Mathieu
   Trudel-Lapierre!

Bug fixes:
 - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix crash introduced in 1.21.1's multiarch
   fixes.
 - report.py: Fix bug patterns to correctly match against compressed report
   fields.

1.21.1 (2011-06-20)
-------------------
Improvements:
 - data/general-hooks/generic.py: Also check for low space on /var. Thanks
   Brian Murray.
 - hookutils.py, attach_file() and attach_file_if_exists(): Add a new
   "overwrite" flag option. If not given, now default to overwriting an
   existing key, as this is usually what you need when attaching files
   (instead of attaching it several times with '_' appended to the keys). You
   can get the old behaviour by setting overwrite=False.

Bug fixes:
 - When showing the size of the full report, take the compressed size of binary
   values instead of their uncompressed size, as the crash db upload will use
   the compressed values.
 - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix for current dpkg with multiarch support.
 - test/run: Fix the test suite to run against the system installed libraries
   with current Python versions (2.6, 2.7) where __file__ does not work any
   more with imports.

1.21 (2011-06-08)
-----------------
Improvements:
 - Supply --desktop option to kdesudo to improve the description which program
   is requesting administrative privileges.
 - apport-checkreports: Exit with status 2 if there are new reports, but apport
   is disabled. This helps crash notification GUIs to not display new crash
   reports in that case. Thanks to Michael Vogt for the original patch.
 - Add data/is-enabled: Shell script to check if apport is enabled. Non-Python
   programs (which can't use apport.packaging.enabled() ) can call this instead
   of having to parse /etc/default/apport themselves, and just check the exit
   code. Inspired by original patch from Michael Vogt, thanks!

Bug fixes:
 - apport-gtk: HTML-escape text for dialogs with URLs. (LP: #750870)
 - dump_acpi_tables.py: Check to see if acpi/tables dir is mounted first.
   Thanks Brian Murray. (LP: #729622)
 - man/apport-cli.1: Document recently added -w/--window option. Thanks Abhinav
   Upadhyay! (LP: #765600)
 - Use kde-open instead of kfmclient to open URLs under KDE. Thanks Philip
   Muškovac. (LP: #765808)

1.20.1 (2011-03-31)
-------------------
Bug fixes:
 - Add bash completion support for new -w/--window option that was introduced
   in 1.20. Thanks Philip Muškovac.
 - apport-unpack: Fix crash if target directory already exists.
 - Fix crash if UnreportableReason is a non-ASCII string. (LP: #738632)
 - Fix crash if application from desktop name is a non-ASCII string.
   (LP: #737799)
 - unkillable_shutdown: Fix rare crash if ExecutablePath does not exist (any
   more). (LP: #537904)
 - kernel_crashdump: Fix crash if the vmcore file disappeared underneath us.
   (LP: #450295)
 - unkillable_shutdown: Fix crash if the checked process terminated underneath
   us. (LP: #540436)
 - ui.py: Properly raise exceptions from the upload thread that happen at its
   very end. (LP: #469943)

1.20 (2011-03-17)
-----------------
Improvements:
 - Add support for -w/--window option which will enable user to select a
   window as a target for filing a problem report. Thanks Abhinav Upadhyay for
   the patch! (LP: #357847)
 - Disable the filtering on SIGABRT without assertion messages. Turns out that
   developers want these crash reports after all. (LP: #729223)
 - Add support for a "DuplicateSignature" report fields. This allows package
   hooks to implement custom duplicate problem handling which doesn't need to
   be hardcoded in Apport itself. Update the launchpad backend to tag such bugs
   as "need-duplicate-check".

Bug fixes:
 - report.py, add_hooks_info(): Properly report TypeErrors from hooks.
 - apport-retrace: Intercept SystemErrors from ill-formed gzip attachments as
   well.
 - Fix crash if crash database configuration does not specify a
   bug_pattern_url. Just assume None. (LP: #731526)
 - If a custom crash database does not specify a bug_pattern_url, fall back to
   using the default database's. (LP: #731526)
 - hookutils.py Update WifiSyslog regex to correctly catch application log
   messages in syslog. Thanks Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre. (LP: #732917)
 - hookutils.py, attach_hardware(): Avoid error message if machine does not
   have a PCI bus. Thanks Marcin Juszkiewicz! (LP: #608449)
 - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Replace deprecated getChanges() call with
   get_changes().
 - apport-gtk: Fix broken dialog heading if the name of the crashed program
   contains an & or other markup specific characters.
 - apport-gtk: Don't crash if GTK cannot be initialized. This usually happens
   without a $DISPLAY or when the session is being shut down. Just print an
   error message. If there are pending crashes, they will be shown again the
   next time a session starts. (LP: #730569)

1.19 (2011-02-28)
-----------------
Bug fixes:
 - Update stack unwind patterns for current glib (slightly changed function
   names), and also ignore a preceding '*'. (LP: #716251)
 - Fix crash_signature() to fail if there is an empty or too short
   StacktraceTop.
 - apt backend: Do not generate a warning if the opportunistically added -dbg
   package does not exist.
 - apt backend: Only add -dbg in --no-pkg mode, as there will be conflicts in
   normal package mode.
 - apt backend: Call tar with target cwd instead of using -C; the latter causes
   an extra openat() call which breaks with current fakechroot.
 - launchpad.py: Fix retracer crash if DistroRelease field does not exist.
 - Convert deprecated failIf()/assert_() TestCase method calls to
   assertFalse()/assertTrue().

Improvements:
 - In apport-bug, if the user specifies a PID referring to a kernel thread,
   do the right thing and file the bug against the kernel
 - In hookutils.attach_dmesg, skip over an initial truncated message if one
   is present (this happens when the ring buffer overflows)
 - Change bug patterns to just use one central file instead of per-package
   files. This allows bug patterns to be written which are not package
   specific, and is easier to maintain as well. IMPORTANT: This changed the
   format of crashdb.conf: bug_pattern_base is now obsolete, and the new
   attribute bug_pattern_url now points to the full URL/path of the patterns
   file. Thanks to Matt Zimmerman!

1.18 (2011-02-16)
-----------------
Bug fixes:
 - Ensure that symptom scripts define a run() function, and don't show them if
   not.
 - Do not show symptom scripts which start with an underscore. These can be
   used for private libraries for the actual symptom scripts.
 - Update bash completion. Thanks Philip Muškovac.
 - etc/default/apport: Remove obsolete "maxsize" setting. (LP: #719564)

Improvements:
 - Remove explicit handling of KDE *.ui files in setup.py, as
   python-distutils-extra 2.24 fixes this. Bump version check.
 - hookutils.py: Add attach_root_command_outputs() to run several commands
   at once. This avoids asking for the password several times. (LP: #716595)

1.17.2 (2011-02-04)
-------------------
Improvements:
 - Be more Python 3 compatible (not fully working with Python 3 yet, though).
 - apt/dpkg backend: Drop support for pre-0.7.9 python-apt API.
 - Add --tag option to add extra tags to reports. (LP: #572504)

Bug fixes:
 - hookutils.py, attach_dmesg(): Do not overwrite already existing dmesg.
 - hookutils.py: Be more robust against file permission errors. (LP: #444678)
 - ui.py: Do not show all the options in --help when invoked as *-bug.
   (LP: #665953)
 - launchpad.py: Adapt test cases to current standard_title() behaviour.

1.17.1 (2011-01-10)
-------------------
Bug fixes:
 - Make the GTK frontend work with GTK 2.0 as well, and drop "3.0" requirement.

1.17 (2010-12-31)
-----------------
Improvements:
 - Better standard bug titles for Python crashes. Thanks Matt Zimmerman!
   (LP: #681574)
 - Add handler for uncaught Java exceptions. There is no integration for
   automatically intercepting all Java crashes yet, see java/README.
   Thanks Matt Zimmerman! (LP: #548877)

Bug fixes:
 - GTK frontend: Require GTK 3.0.
 - launchpad.py: Default to "production" instance, not "edge", since edge is
   obsolete now.
 - hookutils.py, attach_alsa(): Fix crash if /proc/asound/cards does not exist.
   (LP: #626215)
 - ui.py, format_filesize(): Fix to work with stricter locale.format() in
   Python 2.7. (LP: #688535). While we are at it, also change it to use base-10
   units.
 - hookutils.py, package_versions(): Always include all requested package names
   even if they're unknown to us. Thanks Matt Zimmerman! (LP: #695188)
 - launchpad.py: When updating a bug, also add new tags. Thanks Brian Murray!

1.16 (2010-11-19)
-----------------
New features:
 - Port GTK frontend from pygtk2 to GTK+3.0 and gobject-introspection.

Bug fixes:
 - Fix symptoms again. Version 1.15 broke the default symptom directory.
 - Fix memory test case to work with current Python versions, where the SQLite
   integrity check throws a different exception.

1.15 (2010-11-11)
-----------------
New features:
 - Add dump_acpi_tables.py script. This can be called by package hooks which
   need ACPI table information (in particular, kernel bug reports). Thanks to
   Brad Figg for the script!
 - Order symptom descriptions alphabetically. Thanks to Javier Collado.
 - Check $APPORT_SYMPTOMS_DIR environment variable for overriding the system
   default path. Thanks to Javier Collado.

Bug fixes:
 - testsuite: Check that crashdb.conf can have dynamic code to determine DB
   names and options.
 - ui.py test suite: Rewrite _gen_test_crash() to have the test process core
   dump itself, instead of using gdb to do it. The latter fails in ptrace
   restricted environments, such as Ubuntu 10.10.
 - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix handling of /etc/apport/native-origins.d to
   actually work. Thanks Steve Langasek. (LP: #627777)
 - apport-kde: Load correct translation catalogue. Thanks Jonathan Riddell.
   (LP: #633483)
 - launchpad.py: Use launchpadlib to file a bug instead of screen scraping.
   The latter was completely broken with current Launchpad, so this makes the
   test suite actually work again. Thanks to Diogo Matsubara!
 - launchpad.py: Change $APPORT_STAGING to $APPORT_LAUNCHPAD_INSTANCE, so that
   you can now specify "staging", "edge", or "dev" (for a local
   http://launchpad.dev installation). Thanks to Diogo Matsubara!
 - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix crash on empty lines in ProcMaps
   attachment.
 - doc/symptoms.txt: Fix typo, thanks Philip Muskovac. (LP: #590521)
 - apport/hookutils.py: rename ProcCmdLine to ProcKernelCmdLine to not wipe
   wipe out /proc/$pid/cmdline information. (LP: #657091)
 - apport/hookutils.py: attach_file() will not overwrite existing report
   keys, instead appending "_" until the key is unique.
 - Fix --save option to recognise ~, thanks Philip Muškovac. (LP: #657278)
 - Remove escalation_subscription from Ubuntu bug DB definition, turned out to
   not be useful; thanks Brian Murray.
 - launchpad.py: Fix APPORT_LAUNCHPAD_INSTANCE values with a https:// prefix.
 - apt backend: Opportunistically try to install a -dbg package in addition to
   -dbgsym, to increase the chance that at least one of it exists. Thanks
   Daniel J Blueman!

1.14.1 (2010-06-24)
-------------------
Bug fixes:
 - hookutils.py, attach_drm_info(): Sanitize connector names. Thanks Chris
   Halse Rogers! (LP: #597558)
 - bash completion: Complete all path names, apport-bug can be invoked with a
   path to a program. Thanks Philip Muskovac.

1.14 (2010-06-16)
-----------------
New features:
 - hookutils.py: Add new method attach_drm_info() to read and format
   /sys/class/drm/*.

Bug fixes:
 - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix deprecated python-apt variables, thanks David
   Stansby. (LP: #591695)
 - launchpad.py: Fix crash on attachments which are named *.gz, but
   uncompressed. (LP: #574360)
 - hookutils.py, attach_gconf(): Fix defaults parsing for boolean keys.
   (LP: #583109)

1.13.4 (2010-05-04)
-------------------
 - bash completion: Fix error message if /usr/share/apport/symptoms does not
   exist. Thanks Philip Muškovac! (LP: #562118)
 - general-hooks/parse_segv.py: Report stack exhaustion more clearly and
   correctly handle register dereferencing calls.
 - Save/restore environment when calling hooks, in case they change the locale,
   etc. (LP: #564422)
 - hookutils.py, command_output(): Do not set $LC_MESSAGES for the calling
   process/hook, just for the command to be called.
 - ui.py: When displaying strings from system exceptions, decode them into an
   unicode string, to avoid crashing the KDE UI. (LP: #567253)
 - apport-retrace: Fix crash for retracing kernel vmcores, which do not have an
   ExecutablePath.
 - apport-bug manpage: Clarify when apport-collect may be used. Thanks Brian
   Murray! (LP: #537273)
 - generic hook: Check ProcMaps for unpackaged libraries, and ask the user if
   he really wants to continue. If he does, tag the report as "local-libs" and
   add a "LocalLibraries" field to the report with a list of them.
   (LP: #545227)

1.13.3 (2010-04-14)
-------------------
 - data/general-hooks/parse_segv.py: suggest segv-in-kernel possibility.
 - ui.py: When running as root, only show system crash reports, to avoid
   restarting user programs as root. (LP: #445017)

1.13.2 (2010-03-31)
-------------------
 - problem_report.py, write_mime(): Add new optional argument "priority_fields"
   for ordering report keys. Patch by Brian Murray, thanks!
 - launchpad.py: Put some interesting fields first in the report, with the new
   priority_fields argument. Patch by Brian Murray, thanks!
 - packaging-apt-dpkg.py, _install_debug_kernel(): Do not crash on an outdated
   kernel, just return that it is outdated. (LP: #532923)
 - launchpad.py test suite: Add "Referer" HTTP header, now required by
   launchpad.
 - launchpad.py: Fix crash if configuration does not have an "escalated_tag"
   option.
 - launchpad.py: Port to launchpadlib 1.0 API, thanks Michael Bienia for the
   initial patch! (LP: #545009)
 - gtk/apport-gtk-mime.desktop.in, kde/apport-kde-mime.desktop.in: Change
   categories so that these do not ever appear in menu editors. (LP: #449215)
 - launchpad.py: Some LP bugs have broken attachments (this is a bug in
   Launchpad itself). Ignore those instead of crashing.
 - apport-gtk: Turn http:// and https:// links into clickable hyperlinks in
   information and error dialogs. (LP: #516323)
 - apport-retrace: Fix crash when trying to rebuild package info for reports
   without an ExecutablePath. (LP: #436157)
 - ui.py: Fix crash when package information cannot be determined due to broken
   apt status. (LP: #362743)
 - ui.py: Fix crash when /etc/apport/crashdb.conf is damaged; print an
   appropriate error message instead. (LP: #528327)
 - data/kernel_crashdump: Fix crash if log file disappeared underneath us.
   (LP: #510327)
 - data/apport: Fix IOError when apport is called with invalid number of
   arguments, and stderr is not a valid fd. (LP: #467363)
 - hookutils.py: Factor out the DMI collection code from attach_hardware()
   into attach_dmi(), and call that in attach_alsa() as well. Thanks to Brad
   Figg for the patch! (LP: #552091)
 - apport/ui.py: Fix the help output if Apport is invoked under an alternative
   name (like apport-collect). (LP: #539427)

1.13.1 (2010-03-20)
-------------------
Bug fixes:
 - Update parse-segv to handle gdb 7.1 output.
 - Enhance test suite to work with gdb 7.1 as well, and catch future outputs.
 - UI: Add exception string to the "network error" dialog, to better tell what
   the problem is.
 - UI: Add back -p option to apport-collect/apport-update-bug (regression from
   1.13). (LP: #538944)
 - launchpad.py: Add yet another workaround for LP#336866. (LP: #516381)
 - launchpad.py, download(): Ignore attachments with invalid key names.
 - Fix regression from 1.10 which made it impossible for a package hook to set
   a third-party crash database for non-native packages. (LP: #517272)
 - apport-cli: Create the 'details' string only if user wants to view details,
   and do not show files larger than 1MB. Thanks Scott Moser! (LP: #486122)
 - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Silence apt.Cache() spewage to stdout with newer
   python-apt versions. (LP: #531518)

Improvements:
 - unkillable_shutdown: Add list of running processes and blacklisted pids to
   report. (LP: #537262)
 - Sort the report by key in the details view. (LP: #519416)

1.13 (2010-03-10)
-----------------
New features:
 - Add "unkillable_shutdown" script to collect information about processes
   which are still running after sending SIGTERM to them. This can be hooked
   into e. g. /etc/init.d/sendsigs on Debian/Ubuntu systems.

Improvements:
 - apport_python_hook.py: Directly check /etc/default/apport instead of
   querying packaging.enabled(), to avoid importing lots of modules for
   non-packaged scripts. Thanks Stuart Colville! (LP: #528355)

Bug fixes:
 - Fix SegV parser to notice walking off the stack during "call" or "ret"
   (LP: #531672).
 - Fix --help output for bug updating mode (invocation as apport-collect or
   apport-update-bug). (LP: #504116)
 - Fix bug escalation tagging, thanks to Brian Murray.
 - Fix option processing when being invoked as apport-bug. Thanks to Daniel
   Hahler for the patch! (LP: #532944)

1.12.1 (2010-02-22)
-------------------
Bug fixes:
 - launchpad.py: Do not keep escalating bugs, just escalate at the 10th
   duplicate.
 - Improve error message if a symptom script did not determine a package name.
   (LP: #503834)
 - general-hooks/generic.py: Fix crash on libGL check with empty StacktraceTop.
 - Review and clean up usage of chmod(). This fixes a small race condition in the
   Python exception hook where a local attacker could read the information from
   another user's crash report. (LP: #516029)
 - hookutils, package_versions(): Ignore "None" packages, for more robust
   package hooks. (LP: #518295)

1.12 (2010-01-20)
-----------------
Improvements:
 - launchpad.py: Add options 'escalation_subscription' and 'escalation_tag' for
   handling bugs with more than 10 duplicates.
 - crashdb.conf: For Ubuntu, escalate bugs with >= 10 duplicates to
   "ubuntu-bugcontrol" and tag them with "bugpattern-needed". (LP: #487900)
 - general-hooks/generic.py: Filter out crashes on missing GLX (LP: #327673)
 - Add bash completion script. Thanks to Philip Muškovac. (LP: #218933)

Bug fixes:
 - launchpad.py: Drop APPORT_FILES whitelist for download() and instead just
   filter out file extensions that we know about (*.txt and *.gz).
   (LP: #444975)
 - launchpad.py: Do not put the Tags: field into the bug description, since
   they are already proper tags. In download(), convert the real tags back to
   the Tags: field. (LP: #505671)
 - test/crash: Update expected core dump flags for changed rlimit behaviour in
   Linux 2.6.32.
 - launchpad.py: Fix marking of 'checked for duplicate' for bugs with upstream
   tasks.
 - launchpad.py, get_fixed_version(): Do not consider a bug as invalid just
   because it has any invalid distro package task.

1.11 (2009-12-23)
-----------------
Improvements:
 - Add "--save" UI option to store the collected information into an .apport
   file instead of sending it right away. The file can then later be sent
   through apport-bug. Update manpages accordingly.
 - Update all copyright and description headers and consistently format them.
 - Rename all TestCase classes to "_T", which makes it much easier to run
   individual tests from the command line.
 - Testsuite: Verify that report details are/are not shown. This uncovered that
   details about package installation failures were not shown before sending
   them, which is fixed now.

Bug fixes:
 - test/hooks: Do not try to add hook information to kernel_crashdump test
   case, since we do not have an UI here. This test case broke when the system
   had an interactive package hook for the kernel.
 - When reporting a bug from a saved .apport file, let the user review/confirm
   the content before sending.

1.10.1 (2009-12-23)
-------------------
Improvements:
 - Install apport-collect symlink.
 - Update translations from Launchpad.

Bug fixes:
 - Move all remaining option/argument parsing from apport-bug into ui.py. This
   allows the user to add options to apport-bug/apport-collect, and also avoids
   unwieldy dissection of options/arguments in shell.

1.10 (2009-12-19)
-----------------
New features:
 - Add a mode for updating an existing problem report to ui.py (-u/--update).
   This is similar to the Ubuntu specific "apport-collect" tool, but
   implemented the right way now: In particular, this has access to the UI and
   thus can use interactive hooks (LP: #385811) and show you what is being sent
   for confirmation/cancelling (LP: #371827)
 - apport-bug: If invoked as "apport-collect" or "apport-update-bug" (i. e.
   through a symlink), run apport in update mode (-u <number>). This provides a
   convenient no-options command line program. Please note that setup.py does
   not currently install such a symlink. Update the apport-bug manpage
   accordingly.

Improvements:
 - launchpad.py: Use new login_with() to clean up code, and specify allowed
   access levels (WRITE_PRIVATE is the only sensible one anyway). (LP: #410205)
 - New hookutils functions:
   xsession_errors (match lines from ~/.xsession-errors)
   shared_libraries (determine which libraries a binary links with)
   links_with_shared_library (test if a binary links with a particular library)
 - New CrashDatabase API: get_affected_packages(), can_update(), is_reporter()
 - Rename CrashDatabase.update() to update_traces().
 - Add CrashDatabase.update() for adding all new fields of a report. This is
   primarily useful for collecting local standard and package hook data for an
   already existing bug report which was not filed through Apport. This checks
   can_update()/is_reporter() if the user is eligible for updating that
   particular bug. (LP: #485880)

Bug fixes:
 - Ignore SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ; thanks to Kees Cook. (LP: #498074)
 - launchpad.py: Do not mark non-Ubuntu bugs as needs-retrace, since there is
   no retracer right now. (LP: #489794)
 - packaging-apt-dpkg.py, install_retracing_packages(): Do not crash on
   malformed Dependencies.txt lines. (LP: #441709)
 - use-local: Fix for new source tree location of "apport" binary.

1.9.6 (2009-12-01)
------------------
Improvements:
 - Add pm-utils hook to record current operation, so that apportcheckresume can
   check it. Before this was kept in Ubuntu's pm-utils package.
 - general-hooks/generic.py: Check if using ecryptfs, and which directory.
   (LP: #444656)

Bug fixes:
 - launchpad.py: Ensure that text attachments on initial bug filing are valid
   UTF-8. (LP: #453203)
 - man/apport-retrace.1: Document -R option.

1.9.5 (2009-11-20)
------------------
Bug fixes:
 - apport-retrace: Fix crash if InterpreterPath/ExecutablePath do not exist.
 - hookutils.py, attach_alsa(): Attach /proc/cpuinfo too, for CPU flags.
 - Fix crash if InterpreterPath does not exist any more at the time of
   reporting. (LP: #428289)
 - apport-gtk: Connect signals properly, to repair cancel/window close buttons.
   (LP: #427814)
 - Update German translations and fix "konnre" typo. (LP: #484119)

1.9.4 (2009-11-06)
------------------
Bug fixes:
 - Fix crash when ExecutablePath isn't part of a package. (LP: #424965)
 - hookutils.py, attach_hardware(): Anonymize disk labels. Thanks to Marco
   Rodrigues. (LP: #394411)
 - hookutils.py, attach_wifi(): Anonymize encryption key (which appeared in hex
   when being called as root). Thanks to Marco Rodrigues. (LP: #446299)
 - launchpad.py: If unset, set bug task source package also for interpreter
   crashes.
 - apport-gtk: Give details window a minimize/maximize button, which were
   missing in some window managers. Thanks to Marien Zwart. (LP: #447749)
 - apport-kde: Properly terminate program after closing the last dialog.
   (LP: #458662)
 - hookutils.py, attach_alsa(): Attach /proc/asound/version. (LP: #467233)
 - general-hooks/generic.py: Only collect ~/.xsession-errors bits when we have
   an ExecutablePath linked to libgtk.

1.9.3 (2009-10-14)
------------------
Changes:
 - Drop handling of the APPORT_REPORT_THIRDPARTY environment variable and
   "thirdparty" configuration file option. This has never been documented, and
   conceptually does not work. There is a proper mechanism for this in place
   now, e. g. launchpad.py's "project" option.

Bug fixes:
 - hookutils.py: Fix error codes from "comm", thanks to Brian Murray.
 - general-hooks/generic.py: Catch xkbcomp error messages. (LP: #431807)
 - launchpad.py: Assert that we have exactly one of "distro" or "project"
   option.
 - doc/crashdb-conf.txt: Improve documentation of crash database options.
 - apport-gtk: Make Cancel/Send buttons focusable. Thanks to Marco Rodrigues.
   (LP: #447780)

1.9.2 (2009-10-02)
------------------
Improvements:
 - apport-cli: Print the URL and ask whether to open a browser. In many
   situations (such as usage on a server through ssh), it's preferable to not
   open the browser on the reporting computer. Thanks to Matt Zimmerman for the
   initial patch! (LP: #286415)
 - general-hooks/generic.py: Collect important glib errors/assertions (which
   should not have private data) from ~/.xsession-errors (LP: #431807)
 - launchpad.py: Link hardware data submission key if it exists. (LP: #424382)

Bug fixes:
 - apport-cli: Fix crash with non-ASCII characters in prompts.
 - Fix "apport-bug symptomname" to actually work.
 - launchpad.py: Fix crash on invalid credentials file. Thanks to Marco
   Rodrigues for the initial patch! (LP: #414055)

1.9.1 (2009-09-22)
------------------
Bug fixes:
 - hookutils.py, attach_hardware(): Do not attach empty Pccardctl*.
 - apport/report.py, add_gdb_info(): Do not throw away stderr from gdb.
 - data/general-hooks/parse_segv.py:
   + Handle arithmetic wrapping correctly.
   + Handle empty base, scale, or index registers in disassembly.
   + Handle in/out ioport faults.
 - Various improvements to user-visible strings, thanks to Marco Rodrigues!
   (LP: #178507)
 - Various apport-retrace robustifications.
 - setup.py: Fix DistUtilsExtra version check. (LP: #428337)
 - hookutils.py, attach_gconf(): Do not overwrite previous values from other
   packages, thanks Loïc Minier!
 - hookutils.py, attach_gconf(): Fix crash with nonexisting <applyto> tags.

1.9 (2009-09-08)
----------------
New features:
 - Add "do what I mean" mode to command line argument parsing (applies to all
   interfaces: -cli, -gtk, -kde). When giving a single argument and no options,
   determine the most likely mode, like reporting a bug against a symptom,
   package, executable name, or PID.
 - Add program "apport-bug" which determines the most appropriate user
   interface (GTK, KDE, CLI) and files a bug through it, using the single
   argument "do what I mean" mode. This is an improved version of Ubuntu's
   "ubuntu-bug" script.

Bug fixes:
 - Update apport-cli manpage to current set of options and behaviour. Also
   point out that apport-gtk and apport-kde share the same CLI.
 - setup.py now installs apport-{gtk,kde} into $prefix/share/apport/, they are
   not supposed to be called directly. This also reflects the path which the
   .desktop files expect.
 - setup.py now installs the internal helper scripts like "kernel_crashdump",
   "apport", or "apportcheckresume" into $prefix/share/apport instead of
   $prefix/bin.
 - Update usage of gettext to work around Python bug of gettext() not returning
   unicodes, but str. Fixes UnicodeDecodeErrors on translated --help output.

1.8.2 (2009-09-05)
------------------
Bug fixes.

1.8.1 (2009-09-03)
------------------
Lots of bug fixes.

1.8 (2009-08-26)
----------------
New features:
 - Do not generally ignore SIGABRT any more. Try to extract the assertion
   message from the core dump, and add it as "AssertionMessage" field. Mark
   reports as unreportable if they do not have an assertion message and crashed
   with SIGABRT. This requires your glibc to have this patch:
   http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=48dcd0ba
 - report.py, add_hooks_info(): Add optional package/srcpackage argument. Hooks
   can use that to change the affected package or call hooks from different
   packages.
 - KDE frontend implementation of ui_question_userpass(), for crash databases
   which need to ask for credentials.
 - hookutils.py: New funtion attach_wifi() to add wireless network related
   information to reports.

Important bug fixes:
 - Fix the test suite on current kernels; test/crash previously often failed
   with python segfaults, since it killed the test processes too early.

1.7 (2009-08-05):
-----------------
New features:
 - Support for "symptom" scripts, which figure out the package for a bug report
   based on interactive questions.

1.6 (2009-07-15)
----------------
New features:
 - Integrate analysis and retracing of kernel vmcore crashes with the "crash"
   tool. Courtesy of Michael Vogt.

Various little bug fixes.

1.5 (2009-06-29)
----------------
New features:
 - Drop all Makefiles, po/POTFILES.in, and most code from setup.py, and use
   DistUtilsExtras.auto which "just does the right thing" for most build system
   tasks. This requires python-distutils-extra >= 2.2, see
   https://launchpad.net/python-distutils-extra

Cleanup:
 - Move all test scripts into test/, to unclutter source tree.
 - setup.py now auto-detects the required packaging backend if
   apport/packaging_impl.py is not manually installed.

1.4 (2009-06-26)
----------------
New features:
 - Replaced Qt4 frontend with a KDE frontend for better KDE integration.

Major bug fixes:
 - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Add backwards compatibility code for python-apt <
   0.7.9 to not break backportability.

1.3 (2009-06-10)
----------------
New features:
- Interactive package hooks:
  * Add apport.ui.HookUI class which provides GUI functionality such as yes/no
    questions or file dialogs to hooks.
  * add_info() in package hooks now can (optionally) take a second argument which
    is the HookUI instance.
  * See doc/package-hooks.txt for details.
- New function apport.hookutils.root_command_output() to run a command as root,
  through gksu/kdesudo/sudo, depending on the desktop environment.
- Add general hook for analyzing reason of a segfault.

Bug fixes:
- Drop "UnsupportableReason" field, it is too similar to UnreportableReason and
  just confusing.
- Report key names can now contain dashes ('-') and underscores ('_').
  (LP #380811)

1.2.1 (2009-05-15)
------------------
Bug fixes:
- Fix setup.py and PO file merging for recent .glade -> .ui renaming.

Translations:
- Update German translations.

1.2.0 (2009-05-15)
------------------
Moving away from deprecated APIs:
- packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Use python-apt >= 0.7.9 official API and drop usage of
  internal symbols.
- hookutils.py: Drop hal related functions and queries, replace with udev
  database, udev log file, and DMI information from sysfs.
- gtk UI: Convert from libglade to gtk.Builder.

Bug fixes:
- hookutils.py: Drop /proc/version_signature collection, it is Ubuntu specific.
- apportcheckresume: Fix log collection from pm-utils.
- Fix various crashes and report properties for reporting against uninstalled
  packages.

1.1.1 (2009-04-30)
------------------
Security fix:
- etc/cron.daily/apport: Only attempt to remove files and symlinks, do not
  descend into subdirectories of /var/crash/. Doing so might be exploited by a
  race condition between find traversing a huge directory tree, changing an
  existing subdir into a symlink to e. g. /etc/, and finally getting that piped
  to rm. This also changes the find command to not use GNU extensions.  Thanks
  to Stephane Chazelas for discovering this! (LP #357024, CVE-2009-1295)

Bug fixes:
- launchpad.py: Send and read Date: field again, reverting r1128; it is useful
  after all. (LP #349139)
- Only add ProcAttrCurrent to reports if it is not "unconfined", to remove some
  noise from reports.
- Detect invalid PIDs in the UI (such as for kernel processes) and give a
  friendly error message instead of silently doing nothing. (LP #360608)
- Always run common hooks, and run source package hooks if we do not have a
  binary package name. (LP #350131)
- launchpad.py: Consider socket errors when connecting as transient, so
  that crash-digger doesn't stop completely on them.

1.1 (2009-04-20)
----------------
New features:
- Add hookutils methods for attaching relevant packages, greatly improve
  attach_alsa() for sound problem debugging. 
- Move launchpad crash database implementation from ever-breaking
  python-launchpad-bugs (screenscraping) to launchpadlib (official and stable
  Launchpad API).

Bug fixes:
- Drop some remaining distro specific pieces of code.
- Add new field Report.pid which gets set on add_proc_info() and can be used by
  hooks.
- setup.py: Properly clean up all generated files, install missing
  mimetypes/text-x-apport.svg icon symlink.
- Add README file.
- Add translations from Launchpad.
- Remove preloadlib/*; it's undermaintained, and not really useful any more
  these days.
- Various bug fixes; most visible being the misnamed etc/default/apport.default
  file (which should just be etc/default/apport).

1.0 (2009-04-06)
----------------
First upstream release, based on Ubuntu packaging branch; that had been the
de-facto trunk for many years, but this becomes unpractical with several
distributions using it now.
