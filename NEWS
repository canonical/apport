This file summarizes the major and interesting changes for each release. For a
detailled list of changes, please see ChangeLog.

1.3 (UNRELEASED)
------------------
New features:
- Interactive package hooks:
  * Add apport.ui.HookUI class which provides GUI functionality such as yes/no
    questions or file dialogs to hooks.
  * add_info() in package hooks now can (optionally) take a second argument which
    is the HookUI instance.
  * See doc/package-hooks.txt for details.
- New function apport.hookutils.root_command_output() to run a command as root,
  through gksu/kdesudo/sudo, depending on the desktop environment.
- Add general hook for analyzing reason of a segfault.

Bug fixes:
- Drop "UnsupportableReason" field, it is too similar to UnreportableReason and
  just confusing.
- Report key names can now contain dashes ('-') and underscores ('_').
  (LP #380811)

1.2.1 (2009-05-15)
------------------
Bug fixes:
- Fix setup.py and PO file merging for recent .glade -> .ui renaming.

Translations:
- Update German translations.

1.2.0 (2009-05-15)
------------------
Moving away from deprecated APIs:
- packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Use python-apt >= 0.7.9 official API and drop usage of
  internal symbols.
- hookutils.py: Drop hal related functions and queries, replace with udev
  database, udev log file, and DMI information from sysfs.
- gtk UI: Convert from libglade to gtk.Builder.

Bug fixes:
- hookutils.py: Drop /proc/version_signature collection, it is Ubuntu specific.
- apportcheckresume: Fix log collection from pm-utils.
- Fix various crashes and report properties for reporting against uninstalled
  packages.

1.1.1 (2009-04-30)
------------------
Security fix:
- etc/cron.daily/apport: Only attempt to remove files and symlinks, do not
  descend into subdirectories of /var/crash/. Doing so might be exploited by a
  race condition between find traversing a huge directory tree, changing an
  existing subdir into a symlink to e. g. /etc/, and finally getting that piped
  to rm. This also changes the find command to not use GNU extensions.  Thanks
  to Stephane Chazelas for discovering this! (LP #357024, CVE-2009-1295)

Bug fixes:
- launchpad.py: Send and read Date: field again, reverting r1128; it is useful
  after all. (LP #349139)
- Only add ProcAttrCurrent to reports if it is not "unconfined", to remove some
  noise from reports.
- Detect invalid PIDs in the UI (such as for kernel processes) and give a
  friendly error message instead of silently doing nothing. (LP #360608)
- Always run common hooks, and run source package hooks if we do not have a
  binary package name. (LP #350131)
- launchpad.py: Consider socket errors when connecting as transient, so
  that crash-digger doesn't stop completely on them.

1.1 (2009-04-20)
----------------
New features:
- Add hookutils methods for attaching relevant packages, greatly improve
  attach_alsa() for sound problem debugging. 
- Move launchpad crash database implementation from ever-breaking
  python-launchpad-bugs (screenscraping) to launchpadlib (official and stable
  Launchpad API).

Bug fixes:
- Drop some remaining distro specific pieces of code.
- Add new field Report.pid which gets set on add_proc_info() and can be used by
  hooks.
- setup.py: Properly clean up all generated files, install missing
  mimetypes/text-x-apport.svg icon symlink.
- Add README file.
- Add translations from Launchpad.
- Remove preloadlib/*; it's undermaintained, and not really useful any more
  these days.
- Various bug fixes; most visible being the misnamed etc/default/apport.default
  file (which should just be etc/default/apport).

1.0 (2009-04-06)
----------------
First upstream release, based on Ubuntu packaging branch; that had been the
de-facto trunk for many years, but this becomes unpractical with several
distributions using it now.
